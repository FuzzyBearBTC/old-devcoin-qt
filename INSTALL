DEVCOIN-QT INSTALL
=================

In this directory are some files that you need to have in
the "currenct directory" when you run devcoind, devcoin,
or devcoin-qt

The files that must be in the current directory at runtime
are the receiver_*.csv files.

This program uses boost and curl, you will need the
development header files of both to compile it and the
rutime libraries of both to run it.

It also uses Berkeley DB database, you are always free
to upgrade to newest version but cannot downgrade existing
databases such as wallets back to an older version.

----------
COMPILING:
----------

The file devcoin-qt.pro is a project file for the
Qt builder application.

Or, you can use the command qmake (or on some
systems, qmake-qt4) to adapt the Makefile to your
system then make to do the default of the Makefile,
which is to make devcoin-qt

You can make the resulting executable ("devcoin-qt")
smaller by using the strip command.
